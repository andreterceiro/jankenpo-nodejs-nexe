The code was the same of the JavaScript/Node.JS version because I don't want to exercise the programming logic or syntax of Node.JS/Javascript. I wanted to test export a `.exe` file with Nexe.

To generate an `.exe` file with Nexe you will need:

- Nexe (`npm install -g nexe`). Nexe is not in dependencies node in package.json. It is in comments node. You can install it globally;
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/vs/community/). I installed with all options, I am not sure what the exact options are necessary;
- [Nasm](https://www.nasm.us/).

I generated the `.exe` file in Windows.

You can access the [official documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md#windows) of the requirements to build in Windows.

The first compiling process demands a lot of time.
